Exercise

In this exercise, you are going to be working with a new table which stores fictional data about Employees in the film studio and their assigned office Buildings. Some of the buildings are new, so they don't have any employees in them yet, but we need to find some information about them regardless.


Table: buildings (Read-only)
building_name	capacity
1e	24
1w	32
2e	16
2w	20
Table: employees (Read-only)
role	name	building	years_employed
Engineer	Becky A.	1e	4
Engineer	Dan B.	1e	2
Engineer	Sharon F.	1e	6
Engineer	Dan M.	1e	4
Engineer	Malcom S.	1e	1
Artist	Tylar S.	2w	2
Artist	Sherman D.	2w	8
