Exercise

There are a few concepts in this lesson, but all are pretty straight-forward to apply. To spice things up, we've gone and scrambled the Movies table for you in the exercise to better mimic what kind of data you might see in real life. Try and use the necessary keywords and clauses introduced above in your queries.
